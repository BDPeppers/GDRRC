            <p>The GDRRC is a central informational resource on international and domestic alternative dispute
                resolution (ADR) initiatives for academics and practitioners worldwide. By sharing knowledge and
                experience, it aspires to promote the appropriate use and institutionalization of ADR processes
                compatible with justice, economic opportunity, and human dignity through the rule of law. The GDRRC is
                designed to promote a community of practice through crowdsourcing relevant information, providing
                social networking, posting an events calendar, and encouraging engagement through a blog.</p>
